## Hi!

I mostly write about data tech, traveling, personal experiences, etc.

I've been doing lots of things in my life, this is a place where I share it with the world. I hope you like it here.

Trained as an electrical engineer, I picked up work as a embedded engineer for a while then switched to data. Been data monkey-ing ever since under many hats, analyst, scientist, you name it.

Currently an analytics engineer and advocating for the 3rd wave of data analytics with my fellows at [`Joon Solutions`](https://joonsolutions.com)

There's a little bit of everything for everyone.

If you think we should talk more, please, drop me a message and we can have a chat.

Cheers ;)
