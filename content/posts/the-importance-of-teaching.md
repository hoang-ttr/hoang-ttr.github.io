From a young age, we were taught by many people about many things. But rarely did we get taught on how to teach others, unless you major in pedagogy. I has always been a autodidact, so It fascinate me how others teach themseleves.

During univeristy, I got a girlfriend, and somehow we always ended up study together even though she and I were in different departments. Naturally, I would have to study twice for both of our parts. Engineering was exceptionally hard, grumpy professors did not make it any easier. My friends and I usually had to crammed a whole semester worth of content 8 hours before the exam. If we were lucky, we might get just enought to pass, some did not get such privileges.

Eventually, we noticed that It wasn't any good studying on our own. We then decided to team up and divide the materials into parts, each one would handle one or multiple parts depending on their ability. It was during this time that I got to see how others learned, how they taught one another. I felt more pleasure teaching others what I know than actually sitting down and study. To my surprise, I learnt better that way. From then on, whenever we were preparing for midterms or finals, I would go out of my way to help others in need. 

After graduation, I got a fulltime position in engineering, but I had always wanted to use my English to something better than searching weird stuff on ~~xvideos~~ reddit. I applied for a ESL teaching position. The work was very satisfying. My students were from different age groups and from all walks of life. When someone tries their hardest and you see their progress bit by bit, I knew that i would do it for a long time. Even my teaching was recognised by my supervisor and I got to hold a session every week just sharing about English in general. The effort paid off when I got promoted for what I'd done for the team.

But at the same time, juggling between a fulltime job and teaching started to take a toll on my health. I had to stop my part-time gig to focus more on my main career. But since then I've made plans to open classes again when I retire from the corporate world.

People define success in many ways, it's a subjective concept. And to me, I would rather leave behind a legacy where people can benefit from my work long after I'm gone than chasing that materialistic life our society tries so hard to impose upon us.
